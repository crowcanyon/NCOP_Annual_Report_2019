<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.4</span> Area C</h2>
<p>This excavation area comprises four clusters of units (Figure 4, Table
1) that we placed to investigate a prominent mound that extends westward
from the West Great House. Two (C1 and C2) are north-south trenches that
pass through surface room suites and associated pit structures to the
south of the surface rooms (Structures 1002, 1003, 1010, 1018, 1026,
1036, 1042, and 1052). The third (C3) is a large excavation area within
surface architecture northeast of a previously excavated surface
structure (Structure 197). Finally, Area C4 is a large broadside
excavation immediately west of the northwest corner of the West Great
House.</p>
<p>As of 2019, we believe that Excavation Areas C1, C2, and C3 pass through
individual surface structure/pit structure suites within one large
building that people probably first erected in the Pueblo I period and
continued to remodel throughout the Pueblo II period. Area C4 clips the
edge of this building and includes extra-mural midden deposits. We
discuss Area C1, followed by Area C2 and C4. We completed excavation in
Area C3 in 2018 (Fladd et al. 2018) and do not discuss it further.</p>
<div id="excavations-in-area-c1" class="section level3 Heading3" number="3.4.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.4.1</span> Excavations in Area C1</h3>
<p>Crow Canyon began excavations in Excavation Area C1 in 2017 to explore
an anomaly identified during a remote sensing survey and to determine
whether a prominent mound at the west end of the site contained intact
architecture (Charles 2017; Simon et al. 2017). Initially, we laid out a
1 m-wide trench (Table 1). These units contained deposits consistent
with a midden-filled pit structure. In 2018 we added an additional 1
m-wide Excavation Unit (Table 1) on the north end of this trench to
identify any surface architecture associated with the suspected pit
structure. By the end of 2018, we had confirmed that the 1 m-wide trench
had encountered a pit structure (Structure 1003) and an associated
surface room suite to the north (Structure 1010) (Figure 6, Fladd et al.
2018). We added Segment 4 to explore the eastern extent of the back wall
of Structure 1010 (Figure 5).</p>
<p>During the 2018–2019 winter, portions of the 1 m-wide trench collapsed
due to erosion. We used a backhoe to excavate Segment 5 along the west
edge of the original trench (Figure 5), which served the dual purpose of
removing the slumping trench wall and stepping back the trench for
safety reasons. After excavating Segment 5, we added a 1.5-x-1-m
Excavation Unit to explore a portion Structure 1003. We also created a
2.75-x-0.65-m Excavation Unit (Table 1) after backhoe excavation
revealed part of the ventilator shaft of Structure 1003. Finally, we
added Segment 9 to remove a small baulk of sediment outside of 4x1 461N
370E which was clinging to the west wall of Structure 1010 (Figure 5).
Taken together, the Excavation Units within Area C1 expose portions of a
surface structure/pit structure suite. Based on sherds observed during
excavation and through in-field washing of selected artifacts, we
believe that the structures in Area C1 date to the Pueblo II period,
although we suspect that earlier contexts exist beneath those that we
have currently exposed.</p>
<div id="nonstructure-192" class="section level4" number="3.4.1.1">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">3.4.1.1</span> Nonstructure 192</h4>
<p>This Study Unit is a midden deposit filling the depression created by
Structure 1003. Numerous lenses and layers of dark, ashy, charcoal and
faunal-rich sediment characterize this midden deposit. Preliminary
laboratory analysis has identified several miniature “basket effigy”
objects (see Jolie and Webster 2015) within Nonstructure 192, and the
deposits contain a disproportionately high quantity of ladle fragments
and ladle handles. Preliminary evaluation of the sherds from
Nonstructure 192 suggest that it dates to the Pueblo II period.</p>
</div>
<div id="structure-1003" class="section level4" number="3.4.1.2">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">3.4.1.2</span> Structure 1003</h4>
<p>This is a masonry-lined pit structure with a ventilator shaft located to
the south. Nonstructure 192 fills the upper portion of Structure 1003.
Our excavations are currently within the roof-fall deposits of this
structure. Roof deposits are thick, indicating that the structure had a
substantial roof. So far, we have not identified a bench, and the
masonry lining extends from our current excavation level to the top of
the structure. However, there are subtle differences in the masonry used
in the lower and upper courses of the north pit structure wall, and we
suspect that further investigation will reveal that this pit structure
went through multiple construction phases.</p>
<p>In 2018 we submitted two maize samples from Structure 1003 to Beta
Analytic for AMS radiocarbon dating. Both samples were charred cobs that
originated in midden deposits overlying the collapsed roof. We obtained
the results in early 2019. One sample produced a result of 980 +/- 30
B.P. (Beta-516073; burned maize; δ<sup>13</sup>C -11.8 o/oo) with a calibrated
date of A.D. 993-1058 (46.0%) or 1070-1154 (49.4%); the other 910 +/- 30
B.P. (Beta-516072; burned maize; δ<sup>13</sup>C -11.8 o/oo) with a calibrated
date of A.D. 1033-1190 (94.0%). See Table 3 in the “Chronometric Sample
Analysis” section for more details on radiocarbon results. Both dates
are consistent with Structure 1003 falling out of use during the middle
or late Pueblo II period.</p>
</div>
<div id="structure-1010" class="section level4" number="3.4.1.3">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">3.4.1.3</span> Structure 1010</h4>
<p>Structure 1010 is a surface room located north of and immediately
adjacent to Structure 1003. Its position suggests that it is a “front”
room or “habitation” room, although we have not yet determined whether
there are corresponding “back” rooms. We have identified the south,
west, and north walls of Structure 1010—they are constructed of
tabular sandstone masonry held together by courses of adobe mortar.
Several courses of the west and north walls are well preserved.
Excavators identified a thin, prepared floor surface associated with the
three walls consisting of a layer of caliche and clay-rich sediment. We
did not immediately recognize the floor surface and excavators
inadvertently removed portions.</p>
<p>The north wall continues westward past the northwest corner of Structure
1010, indicating that there is probably an additional room to the west.
We conducted further work in Segment 4, a trench intended to follow the
north wall of Structure 1010 to the east. We found few intact stones and
believe that structure’s inhabitants may have dismantled this wall and
recycled the stone elsewhere. The west wall sits on fill and is located
above what appears to be a thermal feature that has not yet been
assigned a feature number; we therefore think that the west wall is a
later addition subdividing a previously larger room and corresponding to
the creation of the floor surface. Our excavation below the prepared
floor surface also identified an alignment of sandstone blocks, mortar,
and plaster that is almost certainly a room corner within an earlier
structure. We plan to investigate the architectural features lying below
Structure 1010 during the 2020 field season. Based on sherds observed
during excavation, Structure 1010 probably dates to the Pueblo II
period.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.4.2</span> Excavations in Area C2</h3>
<p>Crow Canyon commenced excavation of the Area C2 in 2017 to explore a
series of anomalies revealed by electrical resistance survey (Simon et
al. 2017:7). The excavation area was originally conceived as a 1 m-wide,
6 m-long trench, and work on this trench continued through the 2018
season (Table 1). Excavation revealed the south wall of an earthen pit
structure (Structure 1002—Figure 6) that was filled with deep,
stratified midden deposits (Fladd et al. 2018).</p>
<p>Like Excavation Area C1, the trench wall collapsed during the winter of
2018–2019 due to erosion, and in early 2019, we used a backhoe to
excavate Segment 6 (Figure 5, Table 1) on the east side of the original
trench with the intent of removing collapsed debris and making the
trench safe for further excavation work. We removed upper fill and
deposits that the adjacent trench had already sampled, but quickly
ceased backhoe operations after encountering the masonry lining of an
additional, slightly later pit structure (Structure 1018—Figure 6).
The field crew created a 3.5-x-1-m Excavation Unit (Table 1) within the
trench created by Segment 6 to explore Structure 1018. Continued
excavation within Structure 1002 during 2019 revealed the existence of a
third earthen-walled pit structure (Structure 1036) excavated into the
fill of Structure 1002 and cut into by Structure 1018 (Figure 6).</p>
<p>In the spring of 2019, Crow Canyon began excavation to the north of this
trench in order to identify associated surface rooms (Table 1). In
addition, excavation sought to understand how these rooms related to
visible walls in Area C3 to the east, and to structures identified to
the west in Area C1. Excavation commenced first in 3x2 459N 376E and
identified the masonry walls of a surface room designated Structure
1026. Below Structure 1026 was a second, earlier room with slightly
different masonry wall alignments which we designated Structure 1042. It
was not clear how these two rooms related to one another, so we created
Segment 11 to locate their southeast corner (Table 1, Figure 5). We
added a second unit to the north (Figure 4, Table 1) to search for
presumed back “storage” rooms of the structure, and identified Structure
1052, a masonry surface room (Figure 6).</p>
<p>Taken as a whole, these seven units reveal a north-south slice through a
surface structure/pit structure suite. Preliminary evaluation of sherds
and diagnostic artifacts observed during excavation suggest that people
inhabited and used these structures between the Pueblo I and late Pueblo
II periods. We will first discuss excavation efforts in the trench that
exposes Structures 1002, 1018, and 1036, and then the excavations within
the surface rooms (Structures 1026, 1042, and 1052).</p>
<div id="structure-1018" class="section level4" number="3.4.2.1">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">3.4.2.1</span> Structure 1018</h4>
<p>We encountered Structure 1018 during the excavation of Segment 6. The
masonry lining appeared as an arc of stones, leading us to cease backhoe
operations. We created a grid unit (3.5x1 452N 375.5E) atop the visible
portion of the structure. The majority of Structure 1018 lies outside
the Excavation Units—our investigations have exposed, at most, the
western 15–20 percent of the structure. Excavation revealed layers of
post-occupation midden deposits and roof fall before encountering a
prepared surface that we initially interpreted as the structure’s bench.
A slab-lined feature (BNS 2) lies in/on the surface and extends out of
the excavation area.</p>
<p>After further investigation of the eastern profile face of Segment 6 and
3.5x1 452N 375.5E we realized that backhoe operations removed parts of
an upper, earthen lining wall and that what we had initially considered
the bench was actually a floor surface. Our current interpretation is
that Structure 1018 is a pit structure with architectural features
transitional between earthen-walled pit structures and later
masonry-lined kivas. The structure has a high bench. Upright slabs cover
the lowest portion of the bench face; stacked tabular masonry rests on
these upright slabs and covers the upper half of the bench. The bench
surface is mostly earthen as are the upper structure walls. Visible in
the unit profile are two roof supports that are set on the earthen
bench. They consist of rotted, upright wooden posts, set within an adobe
collar and encased in a small box of tabular masonry. The posts are set
back slightly from the bench face. Comparison with pit structure
architecture at the Stix and Leaves site (Bradley 2010) suggests that
this structure could be early-to-mid Pueblo II in age. Crow Canyon will
continue excavation and documentation of this structure in 2020.</p>

<div id="nonstructure-1017" class="section level4" number="3.4.2.2">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">3.4.2.2</span> Nonstructure 1017</h4>
<p>This is a deep, stratified midden deposit located within Structures 1002
and 1036. Lenses of dark, ashy sediment rich with faunal remains and
charcoal characterize Nonstructure 1017, and many sherds and flakes have
been recovered from this stratum. Stratigraphy suggests that the
deposition of Nonstructure 1017 post-dates the use of Structure 1036.
The protected location of Nonstructure 1017 (in a pit) has contributed
to excellent preservation of faunal remains. Excavation in Nonstructure
1017 occurred during both 2017 and 2018. The laboratory staff recovered
a piece of charred maize cob while processing flotation samples from the
2018 season. We submitted this charred maize fragment to Beta Analytic
for AMS dating in late 2018. The cob produced a date of 1120 +/-30 B.P.
(Beta-516071; burned maize; δ<sup>13</sup>C -11.7 o/oo), with a calibrated date
of A.D. 862-994 (91.8%). See Table 3 and the “Chronometric Sample
Analysis” section for further details on radiocarbon dates. This AMS
date is consistent with sherds observed during excavation, which suggest
a late Pueblo I and early Pueblo II period date for the lower portion of
Nonstructure 1017.</p>
</div>
<div id="structure-1036" class="section level4" number="3.4.2.3">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">3.4.2.3</span> Structure 1036</h4>
<p>Structure 1036 is a rectangular, earthen-walled pit structure excavated
into the fill of Structure 1002 (Figure 6). Structure 1018 has partially
cut into the east side of Structure 1036 (Figure 6). Nonstructure 1017
is situated above the roof/wall fall of Structure 1036 and fills the
portions of Structure 1002 not removed by the construction of Structure
1036. Excavations during 2018 probably removed portions of the upper
walls of Structure 1036; we noticed the pit structure in 2019 in the
profiles of the Excavation Unit. The northeast corner of Structure 1036
became visible after we shovel-scraped the base of Segment 6 north of
Structure 1018. Currently excavations are within presumed roof/wall fall
strata below Nonstructure 1017, and as of the end of the 2019 field
season we have not identified a floor surface within Structure 1036.
Based on the AMS date (see Table 3) from Nonstructure 1017 (a midden
deposited after Structure 1036 was no longer in use) we think that this
pit structure dates to the late Pueblo I period or possibly the early
Pueblo II period.</p>

<div id="arbitrary-1011" class="section level4" number="3.4.2.4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">3.4.2.4</span> Arbitrary 1011</h4>
<p>This is a deposit of natural wind-and-water-laid sediments within
Structure 1002. It is most visible at the north end of 3x1 454N 374E.
Arbitrary 1011 filled in Structure 1002 after it was no longer in use.
After an undetermined interval of time, inhabitants of the site built
Structure 1036 within the fill of Structure 1002, cutting through
Arbitrary 1011. It is possible, though not yet confirmed, that Arbitrary
1011 correlates with Nonstructure 1060 in Area C4—both natural
deposits are situated near the transition between Pueblo I and Pueblo II
deposits.</p>
</div>
<div id="structure-1002" class="section level4" number="3.4.2.5">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">3.4.2.5</span> Structure 1002</h4>
<p>Structure 1002 is a large, earthen-walled pit structure (Figure 6). We
have identified the southern wall of Structure 1002 about 50–100 cm
north of the southern profile face of 3x1 451N 374E. The northern wall
of the pit structure seems to be located beyond the north edge of 3x1
454N 374E, suggesting that the structure measures at least 5–6 m
across. The visible portions of the southern wall are oxidized and
covered in soot, which leads us to believe that Structure 1002 may have
burned. As of 2019 we have not identified a floor surface associated
with Structure 1002. After people no longer lived in Structure 1002, it
filled with naturally deposited sediments (Arbitrary 1011). Following an
undetermined interval of time, site inhabitants built Structure 1036
within the partially filled pit of Structure 1002. We do not yet know to
what extent Structure 1036 has affected the preservation of deposits or
floor features within Structure 1002. Structure 1018 may have affected
the preservation of the eastern edge of Structure 1002, as well. Midden
deposits (Nonstructure 1017) fill both Structure 1002 and Structure
1036. Based on the dates from Nonstructure 1017 and the superpositioning
of Structure 1036 and Structure 1018, we currently suspect that
Structure 1002 dates to the Pueblo I period.</p>

<h4><span class="header-section-number">3.4.2.6</span> Arbitrary 171, 1023</h4>
<p>These Study Units are the upper fill covering Structures 1026, 1042, and
1052. Arbitrary 171 is the modern surface and uppermost topsoil near
Excavation Area C. It is mostly wind-blown, post-occupational sediments
and a thin veneer of soil. Recent (1970s–present) activity has
undoubtedly affected this Study Unit, as there is evidence for brush
clearing/burning and some trash dumping. However, it has not been bladed
or graded, nor is it redeposited debris from the West Great House.
Arbitrary 1023 is the collapsed walls from Structures 1026, 1042, and
1052. It consists of jumbled sandstone masonry mixed with some artifacts
and post-occupational wind-and-water laid sediments.</p>

<div id="nonstructure-1048" class="section level4" number="3.4.2.7">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">3.4.2.7</span> Nonstructure 1048</h4>
<p>This Study Unit refers to an ephemeral, extra-mural use surface
identified in the wall fall (Arbitrary 1023) within Structure 1052.
There are two features associated with Nonstructure 1048—a deposit of
broken ground stone fragments within a shallow pit (OTH 1) and a small
patch of burned sediment (BSP 2) that may be the remains of a small
fire. In addition, we documented several unusual artifacts on
Nonstructure 1048, such as a hafted knife fragment, biface fragments,
and gaming pieces. Several stones from the collapsed wall stratum
(Arbitrary 1023) seemed to be displaced from their original location,
though we could not determine if they comprised a constructed cultural
feature. Nonstructure 1048 and its associated artifacts and features may
represent votive deposits introduced into the fill of Structure 1052
after the structure had partially collapsed. Artifacts observed during
excavation suggest that this activity probably dates to the middle
Pueblo II period or later.</p>
</div>
<div id="structure-1052" class="section level4" number="3.4.2.8">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">3.4.2.8</span> Structure 1052</h4>
<p>This Study Unit is a surface room located north of Structure 1026/1042
in Excavation Unit 3x2 462N 376E (Figure 6). Its south wall is the north
wall of Structure 1026, and its position suggests it was a “back” room
or “storage” room that formed part of a suite with Structure 1026. Our
work has exposed the western portion of the room; it is not yet clear
how much extends eastward out of the Excavation Unit. The walls of
Structure 1052 are medium-to-large sandstone cobbles held together with
clay-rich mortar. We have exposed at most about three courses of stone.
The northwest corner of Structure 1052 is well preserved, but we have
not yet fully defined the southeast corner. The lack of intact stones in
the southeast corner and the relatively thin deposit of wall fall
(Arbitrary 1023) within Structure 1052 suggest that the inhabitants of
the site may have removed stones from the structure for use elsewhere on
the site. Our excavations in 2019 encountered a thin layer of roof
deposits or post-occupation sediments and identified the upper portion
of a slab-lined feature (not yet given a feature designation/number),
but we did not encounter the floor of Structure 1052.</p>
</div>
<div id="structure-1026" class="section level4" number="3.4.2.9">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">3.4.2.9</span> Structure 1026</h4>
<p>This is a surface room located north of Structures 1002, 1036, and 1018
and south of Structure 1052 (Figure 6). The position of Structure 1026
suggests it is a “front” room or “habitation” room. The elevation of
Structure 1026 suggests it is probably part of a suite with Structure
1052 to the north. Structure 1026 is located above Structure 1042 and
utilized the same south and east walls. The north wall of Structure 1026
is the south wall of Structure 1052. The upper courses of the south and
east walls consist of medium-large sandstone cobbles held together with
clay-rich mortar, while the lower courses are made of smaller, tabular
sandstone and greater quantities of mortar. We think it is possible that
the lower courses are the original wall fabric associated with earlier
Structure 1042 and the change in style exhibited by the upper courses is
the result of people rebuilding the walls when they constructed
Structure 1026. The north wall is entirely medium-large sandstone
cobbles and rests on fill within Structure 1042, reinforcing our
interpretation that Structure 1026 represents a significant remodel that
changed the size and layout of an earlier structure. The floor of
Structure 1026 was prepared and consisted of a thin (~1–2 cm) layer of
grey, loamy clay spread atop an underlying midden deposit (Nonstructure
1035). This prepared surface was best preserved in the north half of the
room. We excavated four features within Structure 1026—a mealing bin
(MEB 1), an ephemeral fire pit (BSP 2), and two slab-lined postholes
(POS 3 and POS 4). One of the postholes was in the southeast corner of
the room, while the other was located close to the south wall about 1.25
m to the northwest. Rodent burrows badly affected the preservation of
deposits in the southern half of the room, including the mealing bin and
the ephemeral fire pit. Sherds observed during excavation suggest that
Structure 1026 dates to the Pueblo II period.</p>

<h4><span class="header-section-number">3.4.2.10</span> Nonstructure 1035</h4>
<p>This is a midden deposit located above the roof-fall deposit within
Structure 1042 and below the prepared floor of Structure 1026. People
briefly used Structure 1042 for trash deposition after they no longer
used it for habitation and before they remodeled the structure to create
Structure 1026. Nonstructure 1035 was best preserved in the northern and
western parts of 3x2 459N 376E. The rodent burrows that affected the
floor of Structure 1026 also affected Nonstructure 1035. In addition, we
think that when people constructed the mealing bin on the floor of
Structure 1026 they cut into deposits below the floor, including
Nonstructure 1035 and some of the fill of Structure 1042. Based on
sherds observed during excavation, Nonstructure 1035 probably dates to
the Pueblo II period.</p>

<div id="structure-1042" class="section level4" number="3.4.2.11">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">3.4.2.11</span> Structure 1042</h4>
<p>Structure 1042 is a surface room that is below Structure 1026 (Figure
6). It is located north of Structures 1002, 1036, and 1018, and south of
Structure 1052. Structure 1042 is probably a “front” or “habitation”
room, but we have not yet confirmed whether Structure 1052 is temporally
associated with Structure 1042, or if there is an earlier “back” room
beneath Structure 1052. Structure 1042 utilizes the same south and east
walls as Structure 1026, though it is possible that people significantly
remodeled the upper courses of these walls when constructing Structure
1026. We encountered two strata within Structure 1042. The upper stratum
was a thin midden deposit (Nonstructure 1035), indicating that people
used the room for trash deposition when it was no longer inhabited. The
lower stratum was a thin layer of caliche-flecked sediment that was
probably roof fall. The remains of the roof lay directly atop an
ephemeral, use-compacted floor surface. There were dozens of artifacts
laying on the floor (Figure 8). We identified two features associated
with the floor in Structure 1042, both of which are only partially
within the Excavation Unit (3x2 459N 376E). One was an ephemeral fire
pit (BSP 1) bisected by the west profile. The other is a pit feature
(PNS 2) bisected by the north profile which we only partially excavated
by the end of the 2019 field season. Our preliminary evaluation of
artifacts from the floor assemblage suggest that Structure 1042 dates to
the early Pueblo II period. We excavated a test window beneath the floor
surface and it revealed that there are additional cultural deposits
below Structure 1042.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.4.3</span> Excavations in Area C4</h3>
<p>This excavation area is located due west of the northwestern corner of
the remnant standing walls of the West Great House (Figure 4). Crow
Canyon began excavation here in 2017 to expose the exterior masonry of
the West Great House and to search for low-visibility architectural
traits, such as a Chaco-style footer trench (Simon et al. 2017).
Investigations continued in 2018 (Fladd et al. 2018). Work originally
began in two 2-x-4-m Excavation Units (Table 1). During 2019, we
confirmed the existence of a foundation trench associated with the West
Great House, and revealed that the great house is constructed above
earlier, deeply stratified midden deposits (Nonstructure 196 and
Nonstructure 1020). Below these middens were two use surfaces probably
associated with a wall segment in the far southwest corner of 2x4 452.4N
390.5E. This wall segment is probably an exterior wall to a room,
possibly a room in the same building that we have encountered in Areas
C1, C2, and C3. Two additional wall segments encountered in the
northwest corner of the same unit proved to be a corner belonging to
Structure 1016.</p>
<p>In 2019, we placed a third 2-x-4-m Excavation Unit (Table 1) to explore
Structure 1016, thought to be roughly contemporaneous with the West
Great House. We also created Segment 12 to define the northwest corner
of Structure 1016 so we could estimate the floor area of the room
(Figure 5). Our interpretations of the deposits within this excavation
area became more complex as excavation proceeded in 2019, so we include
descriptions of a few Study Units that we previously excavated in
2017–2018. These units have exposed a stratigraphic sequence extending
from the early Pueblo I period to the Chaco-era occupation of the Haynie
site during the late Pueblo II period.</p>

<h4><span class="header-section-number">3.4.3.1</span> Arbitrary 184, 174, 1033</h4>
<p>These Study Units comprise the upper fill of this excavation area.
Arbitrary 184 is composed of masonry, mortar, and other debris from the
collapsed western wall of the West Great House. It lies deepest against
the remnant standing west wall of the great house, and patterned wall
fall extends for nearly four meters to the east. The wall fall debris is
truncated within 2x4 452.4N 390.5E by an area of disturbed deposits
possibly related to mechanical excavation during the 1970s and 1980s.
Arbitrary 174 is a deposit of sandstone rubble, adobe and mortar
fragments, and artifacts that were probably disturbed and/or redeposited
by mechanical activities in the 1970s–1980s. Arbitrary 1033 is the
post-occupational debris overlying Structure 1016 in 2x4 454.4N 389E.
Wall fall from the West Great House does not extend as far northwest as
Structure 1016, and mechanical disturbance of the area appeared limited,
so we gave the post-occupational fill above Structure 1016 its own Study
Unit.</p>

<p>This Study Unit refers to a thin layer of reddish, wind-and-water-lain,
silty sediment immediately below wall-fall (Arbitrary 184) adjacent to
the west wall of the West Great House. Nonstructure 1054 is a natural
post-occupational deposit composed of a combination of “melted” exterior
wall plaster, crumbling mortar, and naturally deposited silts. It
probably formed shortly after people ceased to maintain the
architectural fabric of the West Great House, but prior to wall
collapse.</p>

midden). Its placement created Nonstructure 1056. We interpret this to
be a purposeful deposition event associated with the initial
construction of the West Great House. The placement of Nonstructure 1057
capped existing midden deposits (Nonstructure 196) and created a firmer,
level surface off the west side of the West Great House. Nonstructure
1057 extended at least four meters from the great house, but it is

<p>Investigation of Nonstructure 196 began in 2017 and continued throughout
2018 and 2019. Nonstructure 196 is a midden deposit below the West Great
House foundation. It extends to the west beyond the edge of 2x4 452.4N
394.5E. We suspect that the bulk of this midden deposit is located
northeast of the excavation area. The northwest corner of the West Great
House sits atop Nonstructure 196. Nonstructure 196 is separated from
Nonstructure 1020 (a midden) by a thin layer of construction debris
designated Nonstructure 1058. We excavated portions of Nonstructure 196
in 2017 and 2018. After processing a flotation sample from this Study
Unit, the laboratory staff recovered a piece of a charred maize cob,
which we sent to Beta Analytic for AMS dating. This fragment produced a
date of 1140 +/- 30 B.P. (Beta-516763; burned maize; δ<sup>13</sup>C -10.4 o/oo),

disturbance we designated Arbitrary 174. The western portion of
Nonstructure 1058 is clay rich, while the eastern portion dives
downslope towards the east and northeast, and is siltier. We interpret
Nonstructure 1058 as a layer of construction debris (possibly a result
of people remodeling a nearby structure) deposited atop Nonstructure

<h4><span class="header-section-number">3.4.3.8</span> Structure 1016</h4>
<p>Early in the investigation of 2x4 452.4N 390.5E, excavators encountered
the corner of a masonry room, which was designated Structure 1016
(Figure 6, Figure 9). In 2019 we began excavation of 2x4 454.4N 389E and
Segment 12 to document additional portions of this surface room.
Approximately two-thirds of the room lies within our current excavation
area. It is a rectangular masonry room with walls composed of
single-width sandstone cobbles held together with mortar. Only a few
courses of the walls remain intact and there was relatively little wall
fall debris within Structure 1016 (and no evidence for melted adobe)
suggesting that the ancient inhabitants of the site may have salvaged
the stone for use elsewhere nearby. Excavation during 2019 identified
the floor surface in the eastern half of the room; the west half remains
above the floor surface. We identified two possible floor features based
on upright slabs and discolorations of the soil, but we did not excavate
these features in 2019 and have not yet assigned a feature number to
them. Pottery observed during excavation suggests Structure 1016 dates
to the middle or late Pueblo II period.</p>

<div id="nonstructure-1015" class="section level4" number="3.4.3.9">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">3.4.3.9</span> Nonstructure 1015</h4>
<p>We identified an extra-mural use surface (Nonstructure 1015) outside of
Structure 1016. Nonstructure 1015 is best defined northeast, east, and
southeast of Structure 1016. It slopes steeply to the north-northeast. A
few artifacts occurred upon this extra-mural surface.</p>
</div>
<div id="nonstructure-1020" class="section level4" number="3.4.3.10">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">3.4.3.10</span> Nonstructure 1020</h4>
<p>Nonstructure 1020 is a 40–60 cm thick, well-stratified midden deposit
that extends throughout 2x4 452.4N 394.5E and 2x4 452.4N 390.5E. It is
below Nonstructure 196, below the foundation of the West Great House,
and is probably stratigraphically lower than the foundation of Structure
1016. Many thin, alternating layers of dark ashy sediment and harder,
light-colored sediment characterize Nonstructure 1020. We excavated
portions of Nonstructure 1020 in 2018, and the laboratory staff
recovered a piece of charred maize cob while processing a flotation
sample from this Study Unit. We submitted the charred cob fragment to
Beta Analytic for AMS dating in late 2018. The cob produced a date of
1090 +/- 30 B.P. (Beta-516761; charred maize; δ<sup>13</sup>C -12.0 o/oo), with a
calibrated date of A.D. 892-1014 (95.4%). For further details on
radiocarbon dating, see Table 3 and the “Chronometric Sample Analysis”
section. Pottery noted during excavation suggest this midden was
deposited during the early Pueblo II period, which is consistent with
this AMS date.</p>
</div>
<div id="arbitrary-1032" class="section level4" number="3.4.3.11">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">3.4.3.11</span> Arbitrary 1032</h4>
<p>This is a reddish-orange deposit of construction debris that is
cross-bedded with Nonstructure 1020—there are stratified midden
deposits both below and above Arbitrary 1032. Arbitrary 1032 extends
eastward from a wall segment at the far southwest corner of 2x4 452.4N
390.5E. We believe that it is a dump of construction debris (roofing?)
related to a remodeling event in a nearby structure. The inhabitants of
the site deposited Arbitrary 1032 during the same period of time when
they were creating Nonstructure 1020.</p>
</div>
<div id="nonstructure-1060" class="section level4" number="3.4.3.12">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">3.4.3.12</span> Nonstructure 1060</h4>
<p>Nonstructure 1060 refers to laminated wind-and-water-lain sediments
deposited against the east side of a wall segment in 2x4 452.4N 390.5E.
We interpret these sediments to have been naturally deposited during a
period of minimal cultural activity in this portion of the site.
Nonstructure 1060 is below Nonstructure 1020 and above Nonstructure
1031. Based on sherds observed during excavation of strata below and
above Nonstructure 1060, it is possible that these naturally laid
sediments date to the late Pueblo I or early Pueblo II period.</p>
</div>
<div id="nonstructure-1031" class="section level4" number="3.4.3.13">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">3.4.3.13</span> Nonstructure 1031</h4>
<p>This is a midden deposit separated from Nonstructure 1020 by the
naturally laid sediments of Nonstructure 1060 and by a construction
deposit (Arbitrary 1032). To the east the distinction between
Nonstructure 1031 and Nonstructure 1020 was less obvious; we demarcated
the difference between the two deposits by a shift from stratified
(Nonstructure 1020) to unstratified deposits (Nonstructure 1031), and a
thin layer of ashy sediment that appeared to be resting atop
Nonstructure 1031 but below Nonstructure 1020. Based on sherds observed
during excavation, we believe Nonstructure 1031 dates to the late Pueblo
I period.</p>
</div>
<div id="nonstructure-1027" class="section level4" number="3.4.3.14">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">3.4.3.14</span> Nonstructure 1027</h4>
<p>Nonstructure 1027 is an extra-mural use surface associated with four pit
features (PNS 1–4) and a wall segment that is probably the exterior
wall of a structure located to the west. It extends from the base of the
wall segment eastward to the east end of 2x4 452.4N 394.5E and
presumably beyond. We believe that Nonstructure 1027 and the four pit
features excavated into it are contemporaneous with the wall segment
(which may be the eastern, exterior wall of the same building observed
within Excavation Areas C1, C2, and C3). The west half of Nonstructure
1027 sits atop a low mound created by Nonstructure 1043 (construction
deposit) and Nonstructure 1044 (small midden deposit), while the east
half occupies the same planar surface as Nonstructure 1050, an earlier
extra-mural use surface that extends below Nonstructure 1043 and
Nonstructure 1044. Based on sherds observed during excavation,
Nonstructure 1027 probably dates to the late Pueblo I Period.</p>
</div>
<div id="nonstructure-1043" class="section level4" number="3.4.3.15">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">3.4.3.15</span> Nonstructure 1043</h4>
<p>We interpret this Study Unit to be a deposit of harder, clay-rich
sediment used to cap a small midden deposit (Nonstructure 1044) and
create a firm extra-mural activity surface (Nonstructure 1027) west of
the wall segment associated with Nonstructure 1027. Nonstructure 1043
downward to the east across 2x4 452.4N 390.5E but does not extend very
far into 2x4 452.4N 394.5E. Two pit features originating on Nonstructure
1027 are cut into Nonstructure 1043. We believe that people deposited
Nonstructure 1043 at around the same time they constructed the wall
segment, as Nonstructure 1043 abuts the foundation stones at the base of
the wall segment.</p>
</div>
<div id="nonstructure-1044" class="section level4" number="3.4.3.16">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">3.4.3.16</span> Nonstructure 1044</h4>
<p>This is a small midden deposit capped by Nonstructure 1043 and above
Nonstructure 1050 (extra-mural use surface) and Structure 1051.
Nonstructure 1044 seems to extend into 2x4 452.4N 390.5E from the south,
and excavations in 2019 may have only uncovered the northern-most tongue
of a larger midden deposit. A pit feature that originates on
Nonstructure 1027 has partially cut into Nonstructure 1044. Nonstructure
1044 pinches out to the east before reaching two additional pit features
that originates on Nonstructure 1027. Based on sherds observed during
excavation, we believe that Nonstructure 1044 probably dates to the
Pueblo I period.</p>
</div>
<div id="nonstructure-1050" class="section level4" number="3.4.3.17">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">3.4.3.17</span> Nonstructure 1050</h4>
<p>This is an extra-mural use surface that we defined as the origin point
for Structure 1051. In 2x4 452.4N 390.5E Nonstructure 1050 is separated
from Nonstructure 1027 by a small, eastward-sloping mound created by
Nonstructure 1043 and Nonstructure 1044. However, since Nonstructure
1043 and Nonstructure 1044 both pinch out and terminate near the
boundary between the two 2x4 Excavation Units, Nonstructure 1050 and
Nonstructure 1027 are the same planar surface in 2x4 452.4N 394.5E.</p>
</div>
<div id="structure-1051" class="section level4" number="3.4.3.18">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">3.4.3.18</span> Structure 1051</h4>
<p>This probable structure is visible in both plan view and the south
profile face of 2x4 452.4N 390.5E (Figure 6). It does not extend all the
way to the north profile face of that Excavation Unit. Only a portion of
Structure 1051 extends into the excavation area, but what is visible
appears to be oval or circular in shape. The eastern edge is well
defined, exhibiting a clear boundary with Nonstructure 1059 (an earlier
midden deposit). We have not yet fully defined the western edge; in
profile, Structure 1051 abuts redeposited sterile sediment (Arbitrary
1061). The upper sediments filling Structure 1051 are laminated silts
and loams that slope towards the presumed center of the structure. We
currently interpret Structure 1051 to be a shallow pit structure or pit
structure antechamber. We did not excavate the lower interior sediments
of Structure 1051 during the 2019 field season, but pottery observed in
the upper, laminated sediments included Chapin Black-on-white, Abajo
Red-on-orange or Bluff Black-on-red, and Moccasin Grey, a combination
that suggests an early Pueblo I date for Structure 1051.</p>
</div>
<div id="nonstructure-1059" class="section level4" number="3.4.3.19">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">3.4.3.19</span> Nonstructure 1059</h4>
<p>This is a midden deposit that occurs within 2x4 452.4N 394.5E.
Nonstructure 1059 extends only a short way west into 2x4 452.4N 390.5E.
The site’s inhabitants excavated Structure 1051 into Nonstructure 1059,
and a pit feature—which originates on Nonstructure 1027 (an
extra-mural surface)—also intrudes into Nonstructure 1059. Recent
rodent or large mammal activity has badly affected the integrity of
Nonstructure 1059, completely removing portions of the deposit and
introducing pieces of shredded plastic bag into the fill. To the extent
possible, we have separated out the portions of Nonstructure 1059
affected by bioturbation as Arbitrary 1030.</p>
</div>
<div id="arbitrary-1061" class="section level4" number="3.4.3.20">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">3.4.3.20</span> Arbitrary 1061</h4>
<p>This is a small deposit observed in the western half of 2x4 452.4N
390.5E. It is nearly sterile reddish silt loam, but does contain
numerous small flecks and chunks of charcoal. We believe in may be
redeposited sterile sediment, perhaps removed during excavation of a
nearby pit structure. Structure 1051 appears to have been excavated into
this sediment. We explored only a small portion of this Study Unit
during the 2019 field season.</p>
